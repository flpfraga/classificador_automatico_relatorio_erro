"8876,closed,Commit 6423116 broke ban node list functionality in bitcoin-qt debug window,""### Describe the issue";
;
bitcoin-qt: Debug pop-up window, Peers tab, right-click ban node for 1 hour, day, week, year does nothing. Disconnect node still works.;
### Is the issue reproducible?;
;
Yes.;
#### List steps to reproduce below:;
1. build master branch after commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6423116741de2144872389cf63a621539ae79aaa;
2. launch bitcoin-qt (on testnet is advisable);
3. test ban node list right-click functionality on Menu->Help->Debug pop-up window, Peers tab.;

8334,closed,relaypriority calculation error,# relaypriority calculation error";
;
CCoinsViewCache::GetPriority has an overflow bug that affects the relaypriority calculation. ;
The way the arithmetic works in that function is;
;
```;
dResult += coins->vout[txin.prevout.n].nValue * (nHeight-coins->nHeight); 
```;
;
the nValue variable type is int64_t, and the int64_t max value is 9223372036854775807;
for example;
;
```;
nValue value  is 40000000000000;
(nHeight->coins - nHeight )value is 300000 ;
40000000000000 * 300000 > 9223372036854775807 ;
```;
;
so the dResult will be negative number!;
and the AllowFree function will return False, and the high priority transaction with low fee will be reject by node with  error insufficient priority!;
;
I found this bug when I send a transaction with rpc api sendrawtransaction,i debug the source code find it.;
;
and int64_t convert double also will loss accuracy!;

;
"I've been testing out 0.12.0rc3 in pruned mode, and have run into the following error message when restarting Bitcoin Core: """"last wallet synchronisation goes beyond pruned data. You need to -reindex (download the whole blockchain again in case of pruned node)""""";
;
To reproduce:;
0.) Start from scratch, deleting the entire Bitcoin data directory if it exists (leaving no wallet file or blockchain data).;
1.) Install Bitcoin Core;
"2.) Create Bitcoin data directory if it doesn't exist, create bitcoin.conf, set """"prune=550"""" without quotes";
3.) Run Bitcoin Core;
4.) After you've verified, say, 100,000 blocks, close Bitcoin Core. Wait until the warning window to not shutdown/restart computer completely closes.;
5.) Run Bitcoin Core again, let it verify some more, close it again.;
6.) Rinse and repeat step 5...;
;
At some point, I get the above error message on starting Bitcoin Core.;
;
I don't know what exactly is causing this, but if you're like me and you've verified a large amount of blocks and then you're told that you have to start completely over, you'll probably be pissed.;
;
This error message is not new, as a related fix for this kind of error, when converting non-pruned nodes to pruned nodes was made here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6345;
;
"While it's obviously easy to reproduce this error _if_ you try plopping an _already existing_ wallet.dat file into a pruned node data directory and then running Core -- that's not what I've been experiencing. I've been seeing this error with a brand new wallet.dat that was created from scratch _alongside_ a fresh, pruned node.""""";

5984,closed,Private testnet mining is broken in version 0.10.0,We are experimenting issues while mining using RPC API in version 0.10.0 ";
;
Scenario: private testnet, not connected to the public testnet with a custom genesis block. We use it to run integration tests of our software. To reduce the testing time, we restore the blockchain to a known state every time the tests are run. ;
;
The whole system were working perfectly. After upgrading `bitcoind` to version 0.10.0, we cannot mine anymore. `bitcoind` responds with an error 500 with the error message _Bitcoin is downloading blocks..._, even when the daemon has fully reindexed the contents and using the flag `-checkpoints=0`. ;
;
Reading the source code of Bitcoin, we realized there is a check that is causing the daemon to consider it is downloading blocks even when it is not. In `src/rpcmining.cpp` we have this guard:;
;
``` c++;
    if (IsInitialBlockDownload());
"        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_CLIENT_IN_INITIAL_DOWNLOAD, """"Bitcoin is downloading blocks..."""")";
```;
;
So the result of `IsInitialBlockDownload()` is the clue. We have the following implementation.;
;
``` c++;
bool IsInitialBlockDownload();
{;
    LOCK(cs_main);
    if (fImporting || fReindex || chainActive.Height() < Checkpoints::GetTotalBlocksEstimate());
        return true;
    static bool lockIBDState = false;
    if (lockIBDState);
        return false;
    bool state = (chainActive.Height() < pindexBestHeader->nHeight - 24 * 6 ||;
            pindexBestHeader->GetBlockTime() < GetTime() - 24 * 60 * 60);
    if (!state);
        lockIBDState = true;
    return state;
};
```;
;
After some debugging, we found out the problem is caused by the following expression.;
;
``` c++;
pindexBestHeader->GetBlockTime() < GetTime() - 24 * 60 * 60;
```;
;
If we understand it well, a best header mined before 24 hours ago means the initial block is being downloading. That could make sense for mainnet and public testnet, but breaks the possibility to have a private testnet with private miners that had interrupted the mining process at some instant for more than 24 hours. ;
;
We recompiled `bitcoind` with the following expression for `state` variable and the miner succeed to connect to the daemon and is mining without problems. ;
;
``` c++;
    bool state = (chainActive.Height() < pindexBestHeader->nHeight - 24 * 6);
```;
;
We don't understand perfectly what's the purpose of this state calculation and what would be the effect to remove this guard. So we cannot provide a patch to fix it. Any idea on how to fix this issue?;

5715,closed,Implicit temporary CTransaction kept and used as reference after delete,At least 3 locations in the current codebase (including 0.10) use constructs like:";
;
``` C++;
VerifyScript(scriptSig, prevPubKey, flags, SignatureChecker(CMutableTransaction, i));
```;
;
However, this causes an implicit copy of the CMutableTransaction to a temporary CTransaction, which SignatureChecker then saves a reference to. When the constructor completes, (at least within defined behaviour) the temporary is deleted and the SignatureChecker (if used) will still access it by reference.;
;
"At least GCC 4.8 does _not_ warn about this, and silently compiles it. I have seen a """"random"""" crash as a result (in modified code), but cannot systematically reproduce it.";
;
Proposed solutions:;
;
1) Make CMutableTransaction a subclass of CTransaction. This means making GetHash a virtual, which harms performance in hot code (NACK).;
;
2) Make an alternative VerifyScript construct the SignatureChecker. This means it is once again aware of the SignatureChecker constructor parameters (NACK).;
;
3) Make SignatureChecker a template class able to work on either CTransaction or CMutableTransaction. This puts templates into consensus code (NACK).;
;
4) Make a separate MutableSignatureChecker class for CMutableTransactions. No known issues with this approach. (this seems okay);
;
5) Make SignatureChecker store a copy of the CTransaction it is constructed with. This may have performance hits in hot code (NACK?).;
;
Besides fixing this, it should be made harder to accidentally trigger this behaviour by making SignatureChecker reject CMutableTransaction. This can be done by making a private constructor with CMutableTransaction, or by disallowing implicit conversions from CMutableTransaction to CTransaction.;

"I also think that the argument """"if this was a common problem we would have heard about it from more people"""" is wrong:";
;
The number of full nodes is small and shrinking. So there are not that many nodes using a certain version of the software trying to get the whole blockchain working from 0. In my example the Block is from Sept 22, 2014, which implies that all nodes that updated to 0.9.3 (released Sept 27) did not even have to deal with this block. Furthermore, there are many possible combinations of different systems and configuration options, that might affect this kind of problem. We need to accept, that these bugs would be hard to spot! And as a consequence, we have to take people reporting these kinds of problems more seriously!;
;
I bet, that if every node out there were to reindex its blockchain with 0.9.3 there would be a major fork!;

As transactions are removed from the mempool, `mapDeltas` needs to also have these transactions removed.  `ClearPrioritization` is called in `CTxMemPool::removeForBlock` to accomplish this, but there are other ways that transactions are removed from the mempool.  `CTxMemPool::removeConflicts` and `DisconnectTip` in main.cpp both call `CTxMemPool::remove` which is where transactions are erased from `mapTx`.  Perhaps if `ClearPrioritization` were moved to `CTxMemPool::remove` that would be sufficient, but it might be better to store the deltas in the `CTxMemPoolEntry`'s themselves so we don't have to worry about keeping anything in sync.  This would have the downside of storing this extra information for all transactions and not just the few that actually have prioritization deltas.  @luke-jr , maybe you want to have a look?";

4669,closed,peers.dat easily wiped out after unclean shutdown/hasty relaunch,I've found that peers.dat gets wiped out from time to time, manifesting as """"Loaded 0 addresses from peers.dat  <n>ms"""" when it previously had hundreds of peers recorded.  I've associated this power outages/kernel oopses, but seen it more often.  I think I've tracked this down: [`StopNode()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9.2/src/net.cpp#L1760) calls `DumpAddresses()` but doesn't account for how we started up.  When we'd started up and found `.lock` held, we reach `DumpAddresses()` with zero peers and dump an empty database, overwriting the good one.";
;
It's easy to forget about `.lock` after an outage.  When you're tinkering and `bitcoin-cli stop` and hastily relaunch `bitcoind`, which I used to do before I realised (a) that `bitcoin-cli stop` is asynchronous, and (b) just how slow shutdown can sometimes be on my hardware, you trigger the same thing, which I think accounts for every other time I've seen it.  Probably annoys me more because working Tor HS peers are harder to find.;
;
Maybe it's as simple as wrapping the dump in `if (addrman.size() != 0) { ... }`, but I haven't tested it.;

```;
;
If we remove the  last byte on odd lengths in our submitblock handler, it worked fine, but that hides a bug.  bitcoind currently would have accepted that cgminer `submitblock`.;
;
I am not sure if the problem is in ParseHex or jsonspirit get_str, but I think bitcoind shouldn't accept bad hex.;
;
Perhaps a fail test should be added as well.;
;
I added a LogPrintf to bitcoind's submitblock to show it accepts odd length submissions.;

4156,closed,bitcoind hangs on RPC shutdown in wine,I don't quite understand why yet.";
It keeps hanging forever on the line in StopRPCThreads that deletes the rpc_io_service:;
;
```;
delete rpc_io_service; rpc_io_service = NULL
```;
;
So it never properly shuts down. The curious thing is that it gets through all the (assumingly) more time consuming steps before it like joining all the working threads. Removing the line fixes shutdown (but leaks a pointer, so isn't a workable solution).;
;
Haven't tested in Windows proper yet, but usually I've found that Wine is very good at detecting subtle bugs so I am filing this. This happens in the gitian-built executable.;

3957,closed,Missing blk00000.dat doesn't cause failure when retrieving blocks.,Using bitcoind v0.9.0rc2-17-gd33f69a-beta (64-bit).  When using bitcoinj as a client to  to retrieve blocks from bitcoind with the wire protocol recent blocks were able to be retrieved as normal but when starting at the genesis block invalid blocks were being returned.";
;
The following steps were taken:;
1/ complete ver/verack handshake;
2/ send getblocks message using genesis block hash as the locator;
3/ receive inv message with 500 block hashes.  The first 5 were manually validated as correct by checking blockchain.info;
4/ send getblocks message using the same inventory items from the previous inv message.;
5/ 500 block messages returned by bitcoind.  However every block 81 bytes long.  First byte was 0x02 (which is the wrong version for the genesis block) followed by 80 0x00 bytes.;
;
After much investigating it turns out blk00000.dat was missing.  Apparently rather than failing when unable to locate the block in the blockchain bitcoind was returning zeroed arrays of bytes.  Whilst a peer could probably recover from connecting to a bitcoind in this state as it will simply ignore the obviously invalid blocks it's not quite the behaviour you'd expect.  The client behaved completely normally as a client.  Guessing it would have continued to do so unless the wallet contained outputs from the missing blkxxxxx.dat.;
;
Unable to pinpoint when the file was deleted but likely it was several weeks ago and the client has been running happilly without it.;
;
Presumably the indexes where still present as the bitcoind was able to produce a valid inv response to getblocks.;

3118,closed,bitcoind walletpassphrase not working after upgrade from pre 0.8,this is in reference to this issue here";
;
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/916;
;
I am able to perfectly recreate the described issue;
;
If you start with a wallet that is pre 0.8;
;
Replace the bitcoind in /daemon directory with any .8.0+ bitcoind;
;
execute walletpassphrase command this will instantly crash bitcoind;
;
Also there is adverse affects when creating a new btc address when using the getnewaddress method. The newly created address/accounts will not be added to the wallet. and any preceding call will fail. getinfo() etc...;
;
To fix this issue which is a NON issue simply download the desired bitcoind and simply execute it with the command one time;
;
bitcoind.exe -upgradewallet;
;
This simple error which is not technically an error cost me a great deal of time energy and effort. ;
;
The issue 916 is reproducible by running bitcoind with an out of date wallet pre 0.8 since this issue was closed i had to create this post here. Hopefully this will allow the developers to recreate the problem which they could not create before.    ;

2889,closed,Rapidly getting blocks via RPC causes bitcoind to temporarily stop responding to RPC commands,When retrieving blocks from the blockchain using bitcoind RPC commands, bitcoind will temporarily stop sending responses to RPC commands after many thousands of commands if the commands are sent in quick succession. The issue has something to do with timing, since adding a delay to retrieving blocks will make the problem go away.";
;
"This node.js code will display the issue (obviously, replace """"password"""" with your bitcoind password):";
;
``` javascript;
var rpc=require('json-rpc2');
"var bitcoind=rpc.Client.create(8332, """"localhost"""",";
"  """"bitcoinrpc"""", """"password"""")";

```;
;
Note that my development machine has an SSD, and so blocks are retrieved quickly by bitcoind - it may be necessary to use an SSD to reproduce the problem.;
;
"What this code does is to retrieve the genesis block, then get the next block, and the next block, and so on, until it has got all the blocks. Except at around 25,000 or so blocks in (different every time), it will quit when it encounters a """"no response object"""" error. This error has nothing to do with node.js or json-rpc2 - it is a bitcoind error. This can be seen by running bitcoin commands from the command prompt, which result in a """"couldn't connect to server"""" error, e.g.:";
;
```;
> bitcoind getblock 00000000722ecede1cc4edd52a7d416bdafd6528f630926b0021b41a6b57ba5d;
error: couldn't connect to server;
```;
;
After a few seconds, bitcoind will begin responding to commads again. It doesn't crash. It just stops responding to commands for a short while.;
;
By delaying repeated RPC commands, the above code can be fixed to run without freezing bitcoind (notice the 10ms setTimeout):;
;
``` javascript;
var rpc=require('json-rpc2');

"which is a byte-by-byte compare. Attacker with precise clock (being in the same LAN, for example) might learn the RPC password letter by letter, by trying passwords like 'a..."""", """"b..."""", """"c..."""" and observing which took the longest time to verify.";
;
This code in `bitcoinrpc.cpp`:;
;
``` c++;
"            if (mapArgs[""""-rpcpassword""""].size() < 20)";
                MilliSleep(250);
```;

protects from bruteforce for short password. Unfortunately, when run, bitcoind suggest a 32 chars password. Paradoxically short passwords are safer to use than longer ones, wrt to the timing leak.;
;
Here's an example of time independent array comparison: http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/07/timing-independent-array-comparison/;

This was a clean compile from source, running on Gentoo Linux (64-bit).  I compiled this independently of the Gentoo system, so no unusual compiler options or anything like that should have been used.;

I believe it also happens during a block reorganization.  Here is the debug log:;

2770,closed,LevelDB corruption with 0.8.x Mac client,I've run bitcoin-qt Mac client on the latest OSX version since 0.3.x thru to 0.7.2 with literally zero problems ever, on essentially this same hardware setup.";
;
Since the 0.8 update and switch to LevelDB none of the three Mac client releases have worked stably for me and I've had to downgrade to 0.7.2 (with the May 15 workaround) to maintain a stable bitcoin wallet.;
;
Current setup is: MacBook Pro Retina, OSX 10.8.4, bitcoin-qt 0.8.2;
;
"I saw that some of the known corruption issues/bugs were fixed/closed with the 0.8.2 release, so I decided to try the upgrade again.  After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get """"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?"""" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:";

2739,closed,RPC-related hangs on shutdown,I have been debugging some RPC-related shutdown hangs in bitcoin-qt on windows.  The behavior is worse in 0.8.2, but there were problems before 0.8.2 as well.";
"1. In ServiceConnection, there is a loop that processes multiple requests from the same connection as long as """"Connection: close"""" is not specified in the request.  During application shutdown, nothing stops that processing, so a client can continue to make requests indefinitely using an already established connection.  This is new in 0.8.2 -- in 0.8.1 there was a check for fShutdown before processing each request.";
2. If an RPC connection is blocked, for example in ReadHTTPRequestLine, shutdown can be delayed indefinitely while waiting for input from the client.  That can happen due to a misbehaving client, but it can also happen with a well-behaved client that makes multiple requests on the same connection.  After the first request and reply, we will reach ReadHTTPRequestLine and wait until the client has another request to make.  This is not new in 0.8.2.;
;
For now I have worked around the problems by forcing ServiceConnection to close the connection after the first request in all cases.  There is still a possibility of hangs if the client fails to send the first request promptly.;

"Looking at the source code, the decode method does this and throws the """"TX decode failed"""" message if it doesn't work:";
;
``` cpp;
CTransaction tx;
    try {;
        ssData >> tx;
    };
    catch (std::exception &e) {;
"        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_DESERIALIZATION_ERROR, """"TX decode failed"""")";
```;
;
The decode method is similar but performs one extra step. My guess is that that is where the error occurs in my case, but I haven't tested this.;
;
``` cpp;
vector<CTransaction> txVariants;
   while (!ssData.empty());
   {;
       try {;
           CTransaction tx;
           ssData >> tx;
           txVariants.push_back(tx);

1. Create an empty data directory with a testnet bitcoin.conf; e.g.
   mkdir /tmp/d;

"   echo """"rpcuser=abc"""" >> /tmp/d/bitcoin.conf";

2. Run Bitcoin-Qt with -datadir=/tmp/d;

You get a nice green splashscreen, BUT a wallet.dat and blockchain files directly in /tmp/d, not in /tmp/d/testnet3/;

I installed bitcoin for the first time yestarday.;
When i started the application it immediatly started to sync with the network and everything seemed fine. I therefore proceeded and made a transaction to another account to my newly created wallet. After a while though the application suddenly crashes with that message. And now when i startup the app it crashes after a few seconds with the same error message. ;
In the bitcoin application statusbar it says reindexing blocks on disk. ;
After receiving this error i get all kinds of errors on my machine. And when i restart windows it will try to repair the disk. ;

What can i do. How can i transfer the receiving address to another wallet?;

2429,closed,GUI unnecessarly encourages address reuse,Providing a stack list of past receive addresses as a top level GUI element encourages reuse, it makes addresses seem like something scarce which should be conserved. It also can result in people accidentally sending coins to addresses created prior to wallet encryption.";
;
The interface should probably be adjusted to make it clear that used addresses are used and shouldn't be reused, e.g. by only displaying the initial digits of all but the most recent address and requiring context click to get details.;

2405,closed,Crash on Mac with """"Assertion failed: (pfork != NULL)"""""",""Mac OS X 10.7.5";
Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.1;
;
Recently upgraded to Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.1, the new version had started over rechecking the entire block chain.  At about 90% caught up the system crashed (kernel panic / grey screen of death).;
;
After the system crash, Bitcoin-Qt would crash on launch.  A quick search for the problem suggested reinstalling, so I reinstalled to a different folder, and the new installation also crashed on launch.  I didn't look at the crash report before reinstalling, now both installs crash with this error:;
"**""""Assertion failed: (pfork != NULL), function SetBestChain, file src/main.cpp, line 1742""""**.";
I also have 0.6.3 installed, but have not launched it since the first install of 0.8.1.;
;
EDIT:  If you are also having this problem, please share your `debug.log` here _before_ attempting to fix the problem.;

1073,closed,should 'importprivkey' immediately show imported transactions in the client?,I just tried to send funds from a remote wallet back to my local one, but miscalculated how much to send to allow for the transaction fee and ended up with sub-cent change in the remote wallet.  I decided to use the new 'dumpprivkey' and 'importprivkey' commands to bring the sub-cent change home.";
;
After running 'importprivkey' and waiting for it to finish, I can see the coin in the 'coincontrol' tab, but it's not showing up in either 'overview' or 'transactions'.;

i forgot my passphrase to my encrypted wallet. but i knew what it was approximately. so i guessed. 50+ times. one particular guess (which i'm assuming is the correct passphrase) causes the client to crash. so i can't send bitcoins or change my passphrase. updated to client 0.6.0. it also crashes on the same passphrase.;

i haven't looked at the source but... that 83 thousand times thing looks kinda suspicious. is there a security feature that increases the passphrase hash count every time an incorrect passphrase is entered? is there a buffer or stack overflow thing going on when the hash count gets too high? chirp.;

944,closed,bitcoin memory allocation bug, double linked list corrupted "",""Hi, I have been doing tests with bitcoind version 0.6003";
And for mosts tasks  it works ok, however when I run a shopping cart, the bidcoind daemon crashes after a while, no money is lost, no addresses are lost, it simply crashes after about 1 hour of use, if it is being used lightly manual transactions and no shopping cart, it works fine.;
;
This bug can be reproduced by running the shoppping cart oscommerce and the weex module, however I do not think the bug is in the shopping cart module since all it is doing is using the same bitcoind daemon to check transactions repeatedly, and most of the time it works, if fails when the bitcoind crashes.;
;
There is another minor bug, that at times it takes a long time to do a simple transaction like  bitcoind getinfo, most of the time it takes less than a second, but randomly sometimes takes almost a minute.;
;
To simply debuging, I compiled bitcoind without optimization, and debug enabled:;
;
Here is the console error log at crash, not the name of the daemon was bitcoind6003-notoptized-debug, meaning it has no optimizations and debug enabled:;
# ./bitcoind6003-notoptized-debug -server -debug;

Has anyone had similar problems with recent versions of bitcoind, and what was done to fix it?;
;
After doing some research, it appears that this bug depends on the wallet being used, with a clean new wallet it seems to be fine, however  when I used my own wallet that has been around about a years and has gone though many bitcoin updates, I have a feeling is something on my wallet that causes this bug to trigger, and only happens are moderate or heavy use of bitcoind.;

;
"Yesterday night I have encrypted my wallet using bitcoin tool. today when I open bitcoin tool It shows """"loading block index"""" and than throws an error """"Wallet.dat corrupted"""". Now I cannot access my wallet. I'm using Win7 64bit.";
;
I have created new wallet.dat by renaming old wallet.dat to wallet-old.dat. with new wallet the bitcoin tool opens fine, even I can encrypt the new wallet works fine aswell. I just don't know what happened to my original wallet.dat. I'm new to bitcoin topic and I don't understand why the bitcoin folder is 1.3 GB.;
;
Is there any way I can recover my address back? because I have locked that adress in a mining website (deepbit). it would be very thankful if anyone gives clue how to recover the wallet.dat in windows environment. All I see on google is either linux solutions which I have zero knowledge.;
;
PS: I dont mind sharing half of the money the wallet has if i get it back. ;

Your application (using socks4 to port 8333) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information.

"This edit states that the """"default key"""" will be used as the target for payouts for mining. If this is correct, then it might be problematic and could result in a loss of funds to miners. When miners mine more than one block using the same payout address, the coinbase transactions in each block are identical, which results in them having an identical sha256 hash, which results in all but the first one being unidentifiable and hence unspendable.

453,closed,Deadlock in key generation due to CCryptoKeyStore,From the forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34642.0";
;
This is in the latest version in Git.  This is not in the released client.;
;
Creating a new key can freeze the client.  It appears to be much more frequent when there are blocks and transactions to download.;
;
I've been digging in the code to try and find the cause, and I think this is the reason:;
;
CAddressBookDialog::OnButtonNew grabs the cs_vMasterKey, then calls pwalletMain->GetOrReuseKeyFromPool();
GetOrReuseKeyFromPool() calls ReserveKeyFromKeyPool() which attempts to grab cs_main;
;
Meanwhile..;
;
ProcessMessages grabs cs_main and then calls ProcessMessage;
"ProcessMessage() calls SyncWithWallets, either directly when receiving """"tx"""" or indirectly when receiving a block (via ProcessBlock -> AcceptBlock -> AddToBlockIndex -> SetBestChain -> ConnectBlock -> SyncWithWallets)";
SyncWithWallets calls AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe;
AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe calls CWallet::IsMine, which calls the global ::IsMine;
IsMine(const CKeyStore &keystore, const CScript& scriptPubKey) then calls keystore.GetPubKey;
CCryptoKeyStore::GetPubKey then grabs cs_vMasterKey;
;
Deadlock.;
;
Most of the critical sections protect something small well-defined, though I'm not quite sure what cs_main is supposed to be protecting.;
;
I would generate a pull request, except that ;
1. I have an ugly hack but not a good fix.  I'm not sure what the final strategy is going to be on wallet encryption, and whether the public keys are going to be encrypted too.;
2. I am new to git and I am not yet skilled at rebasing commits to include only the changes I want.;

At least in some cases, it seems that a permission error can be returned when an attempt is made to create a directory that already exists if the caller wouldn't have permission to create the directory if it didn't exist. And in some cases, creating the data directory makes no logical sense, for example if the data directory is the root of a USB drive on a Windows system. In these cases, create_directory will throw an exception.;

The client should put the create_directory calls in a try/catch block. If an exception is taken, the code should check if the directory exists and, if so, ignore the exception.;

;
I'm one of the founders of Bitcoins.lc - we're experiencing some problems with bitcoind as a backend.;
The error consists of mainly that the amount of connections between bitcoind and pushpoold is insane.;
;
This is due to the fact the bitcoind does not support keep-alive for RPC-connections. pushpoold is based upon libcurl and should be able to do so out of the box. Each new getwork request from clients opens up a new connection between bitcoind and pushpoold to transfeer data.;

I'd gladly pay 10 BTC for implementing a keep-alive patch for bitcoin.;

330,closed,Non-English Decimal Interpreted Incorrectly in util.cpp:ParseMoney,I did not find this bug, but I'm reporting it:";
;
See:  http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19168.msg240196#msg240196;
;
If you enter 0,005 as amount to be sent, the client sends 5.00 ;
;
For the US-only localized guys I must add: 0,005 is, for example, in Germany the natural way to type what in the US would be typed as 0.005 - and this is consistent with all kinds of localizations in the operating system.;
;
So a German user is likely to send a much higher amount than she intended to.  ;
;
We have the bug confirmed on the 0.3.23-beta client on Windows 7 by Dennis1234 and on the 0.3.23-beta client on Linux self compilation by mself. Since my client is running in testnet currently I did some testing:;
;
"0,0005 is parsed as """"error in amount""""";
0,005 is reparsed as 5.00;
"0,05 produces an """"error in amount""""";
"0,5 produces an """"error in amount""""";
;
Reparsed as 5.00 means the following:;
;
"I enter 0,005 and upon """"Send"""" the displayed amount changes into 5.00 and I get an error on insufficient funds (I do not have 5 BTC in my current testnet account). From the normal behaviour of the client I assume that, if I had more than 5.00 i would just lose these 5.00.";
;
DEVELOPER INFORMATION:;
;
The bug is in src/util.cpp:ParseMoney. In particular, on line 375 the function explicitly checks for ',' and interprets it as the American/English (or other?) digit grouping symbol. It checks if there is a digit before the comma, and three digits after it (e.g. One Million Dollars can be written as $1,000,000).;
;
Because of this 0,005 is considered valid, even though it makes no sense even from an a digit grouping perspective. I'd say several patches are in order:;
;
1) 0,005 should not be considered valid when interpreted as digit grouping;
2) ParseMoney should be locale sensitive;

329,closed,Using setaccount on addresses that are already listed in the Address Book.,The following:";
;
```;
bitcoind setaccount <unknown_address> label ;

;
Using:;
;
```;
bitcoind setaccount <known_sending_address> label ;
```;
;
will rename the sending address listed in the Address Book.;
This is fine, but, in the same time, it will also pop up a new receiving address labeled with the old name.;
This behavior is quite confusing and I think it is not expected.;

Using the GUI, I added a space to some sending address (not on purpose) and for a long time, I could not figure out why its label was not displayed in my list of transactions.;
I think those addresses should be checked for validity.;
;
Using setaccount in bitcoind, validity of addresses are checked.;
(There is another issue with setaccount, but I think it deserves a separate report) ;

263,closed,0.3.22rc2 Says 0.0005 in the warning dialog but takes 0.01 as a fee for small transactions.,Using version 0.3.22rc2 on Windows:";
;
I got 0.02 from the faucet.  I had over 500 confirmations by the time I tried to send it on.  I sent 0.01 and the small transaction dialog popped up saying that I would need to pay the fee of 0.0005.  I accepted by pressing yes and when the transaction posted it took 0.02 from my balance leaving me with 0.00 instead of 0.0095, which is what I should have been left with if 0.0005 had actually been taken from me.  ;
;
This is the transaction: http://blockexplorer.com/tx/223fb42799f90eaafe621a188c3361a2385247893d85b7ddbf02f145b402d811 ;
;
You will notice the amount of the transaction is 0.02 instead of 0.0105 ;
;
Also, possibly related to this bug is the fact that all forms on the interface are hard coded to only accept 0.00  and no more decimal places beyond two.  This seems like it could cause problems sending amounts as small as even the alleged new transaction fee of 0.0005.;

The GUI for the virtual currency program Bitcoin (http://bitcoin.org) does not show up at all.

;
People are starting to complain, see http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3835.msg57031#msg57031 for an example.;
;
This was discussed on #bitcoin-dev;
;
ArtForz> that tx should have a score of 20567855;
ArtForz> so it falls short of the dPriority > COIN \* 144 / 250 test;
ArtForz> and as tx size is > 4000, fAllowFree is never true for it;
theymos> Ah. So it will never confirm?;
ArtForz> probably not;
;
ArtForz> looks like the tx-sending code needs some fixing;
molecular> like not generate a tx with a score too low, or suggest to add a fee?;
ArtForz> yep;
ArtForz> check size and priority of transaction, if it's > 4kB and score < 57600000 require min fee;
ArtForz> maybe reduce the size limit to 3.5k or so, otherwise it can only get into an otherwise empty block;
;
This also seems to imply the possiblity of a DoS-Attack on node RAM, since the tx-queue is kept im RAM. Maybe the transaction cache should not be unlimited?;

64,closed,Accessibility issues,I'm opening this for a blind bitcoin user:";
;
"There are a couple concerns I have with the accessibility of the GUI in Bitcoin. The """"Send Coins"""" and """"Addressbook"""" buttons are not in the tabstop list, so a blind person with a screen reader cannot tab to and activate these buttons. Also, the current address and balance are also not accessible via pressing tab. When arrowing through the list of transactions, the screen reader, rather than starting out with the status (number of confirmations), reads a long number, usually starting out with 00. If you wait long enough, the rest of the table is read, but unfortunately that is a while to wait.";
;
Also, when bringing up transaction details, there is an html window displayed, but absolutely no feedback is given from the screen reader. Last, in the addressbook, tabbing from control to control works fine, but when shift-tabbing, only the list and tab control are tabbed to.;
;
"Of course, most of these concerns, excluding the HTML window which isn't read at all, are not a big deal for myself, as I'm a power user and can use my screen reader's review cursor to read most of the controls. However, there are many blind people who find this method of exploring windows confusing (many will ask """"how did you know that was there?""""), and these fixes will make it easier for them to explore the Bitcoin interface on their own and use it successfully.";

The screen reader I'm using is NVDA, a free and open source screen reader, which can be found at http://www.nvda-project.org.;

26,closed,Confirmations not appearing for sent coins after recovering wallet from archive,I was able to recreate an issue where after sending bitcoins and then restoring the wallet the transaction never shows any confirmations even though the transaction did make it to the recipient and does appear in BlockExplorer.";
;
The steps I performed were:;
1.) Create a new wallet;
2.) Requested a new address;
3.) Received some seed bitcoins (two transactions) to that new address.;
4.) Made an archive of my wallet.;
5.) Sent two test payment transactions.  (to 16W7FAZ8tcX1gDLgDupfAKfpGLYd7XcPRe a 0.02 BTC and a 0.03 BTC);
6.) Recover wallet from archive.;
;
After many blocks passed (more than an hour), the confirmations still shows 0/unconfirmed.  To confirm that the payment was sent, I confirmed:;
  http://blockexplorer.com/address/16W7FAZ8tcX1gDLgDupfAKfpGLYd7XcPRe;
;
To try to get a clean load of blocks, I then purged the blk*.dat, __db*, addr.dat, *.log and database/* (i.e., all files except wallet.dat) and started bitcoin again.;
  $ bitcoin -datadir=.;
;
After letting the client catch up to the most recent block, ... and then waiting at least an hour further, my two test transactions still show 0/unconfirmed.;
;
The test wallet (with 0 BTC balance) that can be used to recreate this issue is at:;
